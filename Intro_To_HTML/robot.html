    A <b>robot</b> is a machine—especially one programmable by a computer—capable of carrying out a complex series of actions automatically.A robot can be guided by an external control device, or the control may be embedded within. <b>Robots</b> may be constructed to evoke human form, but most robots are task-performing machines, designed with an emphasis on stark functionality, rather than expressive aesthetics.
